# consistent-hash
One possible implementation of consistent hash and simulation on add/remove machine from a cluster
# Algorithm
### Access pattern
Item is inserted into and retrived from cluster by hashing an unique identifier
### Hashing
Hashing algorithm is usually presented as "points on a circle"
### Adding Node
# Simulation
